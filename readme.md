# Wordle

Scraped Wayback Machine Wordle files from before 12th Feb 2021, right before New York Times took over. This code is scraped from Archive.org meaning it still has the ability to work exactly the same as before. There's still new words each day but will not have the same words as the official Wordle as it has an easier list of words that it can potentially choose from.
